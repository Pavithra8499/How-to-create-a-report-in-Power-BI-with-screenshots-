2️⃣ Here, you can:

2️⃣ On the right, you’ll see the “Visualizations” pane.
3️⃣ Drag and drop fields from the “Fields” pane to your report canvas.
4️⃣ Choose a visualization type (Bar Chart, Pie Chart, Table, etc.).

Example:
	•	Drag “Sales Amount” to the Y-axis and “Region” to the X-axis to create a bar chart.
